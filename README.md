# Book Tesla Front End
> Web-App built with React where your users can create bookings for a given car.

## About

Book-a-Tesla is a React & Redux project where users can create bookings for a given car. These web-app takes the endpoints from the project [Book Tesla](https://github.com/lu-jim/book-tesla).

## Description

## Built With

- React & Redux
- Chakra UI
- VS Code
- Tailwind
- Babel

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and rails.

## Prerequisites 

- Having a modern internet browser: I.E. Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox.
- Being able to run a local server
- Node

### Install
- Open your console and change the current working directory into the destination for this project.
- Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL copied in the Setup section.
- Type Enter and then enter `cd book-tesla-frontend` to enter into the project directory.
- Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

**Note: Proxy is set up in localhost:8000**

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
